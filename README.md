# 🌐 Static Website Hosting on AWS with CloudFront CDN

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static HTML website on **Amazon S3**, make it publicly accessible via bucket policies, and accelerate delivery using **CloudFront CDN**. The project is part of my hands-on learning in cloud infrastructure and AWS services.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Hosted on S3 using Static Website Hosting
- ✅ Delivered globally via CloudFront with HTTPS
- ✅ Public access secured with IAM and bucket policies
- ✅ Fully under AWS Free Tier (region: `us-east-1`)
- ✅ GitHub-hosted source code for portfolio visibility

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Amazon S3** (Static file storage + hosting)
- **AWS CloudFront** (Content Delivery Network)
- **IAM** (Permissions and access control)
- **HTML/CSS** (Static website)
- **GitHub** (Source control and public project repo)
